## Notes

From [Diachronic Atlas of Comparative Linguistics (DiACL)â€”A database for ancient language typology](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0205313#sec006)

> An important additional resource of the database DiACL is constituted by basic vocabulary lists, consisting of a Swadesh 100-list, analysed by cognacy and with loans removed. Nearly all languages for Eurasia that are in the data set DiACL Typology/ Eurasia have complementary sets of basic vocabulary, with the exception of North-East and North-West Caucasian languages, for which cognacy analysis is not available. The basic vocabulary data set has been compiled according to the same basic principles as the typological set: we aim towards symmetry between extinct and contemporary languages (i.e., concerning polymorphism), and all data points are sourced in reliable literature. The basic vocabulary data set is a useful resource, for instance for testing typological against lexical change, or for establishing a lexical phylogenetic tree, against which gain and loss rates of typological data can be measured. The basic vocabulary data can be retrieved from the following URL: https://diacl.ht.lu.se/WordList/Index.
